# Synopsis

Data collection is costly and in quality-assurance efforts by wine manufacturers, it is paramount to collect only the attributes with the most predictive power while ignoring irrelevant and redundant attributes to achieve high cost-effectiveness. Thus we have invistigated the wine dataset to assess the most informative attributes and discuss the reasons for why those results are reasonable. Furthermore, we tested many linear regression models exluding the less informative attributes and compared them with models that incorportate all attributes. We have found a greate deal of congruency between our hypothises and the results of our expirements.

# Data

| Attribute            | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| fixed_acidity        | Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).                                       |
| volatile_acidity     | The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.                |
| citric_acid          | Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.                                         |
| residual_sugar       | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.                                                                 |
| chlorides            | The amount of salt in the wine.                                                                                         |
| free_sulfur_dioxide  | The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion.                |
| total_sulfur_dioxide | Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine.                       |
| density              | The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.                      |
| pH                   | Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4. |
| sulphates            | A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels.                                                |
| alcohol              | Alcohol percentage; most wines are between %9-%15.                                                                      |
| quality              | The quality of the wine taste based on evaluaters judgment; most wines have rating between 3-8.                         |
